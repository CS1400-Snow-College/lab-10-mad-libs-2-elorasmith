A long time ago, in a evil forest, a lone warrior discovered a loose mob boss .
 Every night, the warrior would punch under the moonlight, dreaming of houses . One stormy evening, he stumbled upon a hidden 
 monster that held a powerful relic . Intrigued, he ventured in and found a lumbering mob boss waiting. They joined 
 forces! Together, they watered and watered to save their townspeople. 
 Their legend is still taught in math classes today.
