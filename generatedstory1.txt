Once upon a time, there was an difficult boy who loved sheep. He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there 
was a difficult mirror attacking his waterbottles .  When the townspeople came, he walked at them. He had 
so much fun that he tried it again the following day and fought at the townspeople when they came to help.  The next day, a flower really did come whistle his sheep and he cooked and fought to call for help, but no one believed him 
and he lost his camel .
