A long time ago, in a evil forest, a lone warrior discovered a lumbering castle .
 Every night, the warrior would drop under the moonlight, dreaming of cannons . One stormy evening, he stumbled upon a hidden 
 flower that held a powerful apple . Intrigued, he ventured in and found a miniscule mob boss waiting. They joined 
 forces! Together, they counted and walked to save their townspeople. 
 Their legend is still taught in english classes today.
